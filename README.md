## Why enroll in a bootcamp?

I managed to find myself stuck in India during the Covid-19 lockdown. After a solid couple of weeks of catching up on my reading list, I started trying out various different online courses in a myriad of topics: from digital marketing, a topic I knew nothing about, to brushing up on my programming skills, something I'd mostly ignored since my undergraduate days. This was the beginning of my journey to Data Science. 

I initially worked with code-along videos on Youtube and eventually came across Udemy. This occupied about a year of my time and gave me a chance to figure out if I actually wanted to pursue a career as a data scientist or if learning about data science was the perfect cure to cabin fever. I was happy to realise I wanted the former, and this led me to my search for data science courses, bootcamps, and university programs. There is a LOT of information out there, ranging in prices and time commitments. I narrowed down General Assembly and Springboard because the courses were quite similar in structure with the biggest difference being Springboard ran a self paced course whilst General Assembly did not. Honestly, I preferred having a more rigorous and structured program, but demands during Covid etc. led to my General Assembly course not working out, so I went with Springboard. 

## Was it worth it? 
I learnt a LOT. I come from a Physics and Engineering background, and have been teaching Maths and Physics for the better part of a decade. And, even with my mathsy background, I still learnt a lot. Not many of the resources were Springboard's original material, but they do give you access to some pretty great resources out there like DataCamp, Databricks, LinkedInLearning, and a collection of lectures. Sure, if you look you might be able to find similar materials online by yourself, but they do the leg work for you. Now, it's pretty easy to skim through the lectures OR you can spend some time going through the material for deeper learning. I think the course is designed so people can decide for themselves how deeply they want to go. Now, that I've finished the course, I do find myself going back through a lot of the material to remind myself on the theory. As for DataCamp and LinkedInLearning, Springboard selects the most suitable chapters/sections of courses where appropriate. However, this doesn't mean you don't have access to the whole lecture or course- for some of the sections where I was less confident I found myself doing more than the recommended subtopics as this helped me gain confidence and brush up on some topics. After I finished the course, I found DataCamp a great way of practicing what I'd learnt. There are quite a few social events organised by them, however, the time-difference between the US and HK didn't make this ideal, particularly as I was also working full time. These are designed to help you network and to give everyone practice in presenting their projects. So was it worth it? Definitely. Maybe, I could have come up with the same set of resources if I'd looked harder, spent more time looking for what I should be doing/reading/watching next. I've not done the calculations for how much LinkedInLearning or DataCamp would have cost me were I to pay for it independently. I was on the pay-as-you-go structure; whilst Springbaord is NOT cheap, I definitely think the resources were worth the money. 


## Job Guarantee
I'll talk about this one briefly as this is only offered for the US and didn't apply for me. In terms of the career service, I actually found their careers advisors to be very helpful but many of them said outright they lacked experience with international placements and job markets. I did get a lot of advice on where to look for jobs and on various international part-time jobsites which was helpful. Overall, the team was great to speak to, but it wasn't ideal for someone in Hong Kong or requiring visas for working outside of Hong Kong in terms of careers services. I did make friends on the course who had the right to work in the US, and they found the service much more helpful. At the end of the day, they specifically do say they can only make this guarantee for the US so if Job Guarantee is something you want from your bootcamp just make sure you have right to work in the US if you go with Springboard.
