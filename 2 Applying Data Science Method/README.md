# Applying the Data Science Method: Developing a Predictive Model for Big Mountain Resort's Pricing Strategy


## Step 1: Problem Identification 
The aim of this step is to synthesize the context and the problems outlined by the client, in this case Big Mountain Resort, into a specific, measureable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound problem statement we will address. 

To synthesize the question I addressed a few criteria: 
1: Context: Its important to first identify the problem we want to solve, but to do so we need to know how the business operates which has resulted in the problem to begin. In this case Big Mountain Resort in Montana has recently had an increase in operation cost of 1.54 Million USD in the last reason as a result of a new chair lift they have installed. While Big Mountain in currently charging a premium rate compared to other ski resorts in the space. Big Mountain Resort does have premium facilities, so they are questioning whether their ticket prices reflect the premium services they offer. 

2. Criteria of Success: This identifies the scope of the problem we are trying to solve. 
In this case Big Mountain recently had an increased operational cost of 1.54 million dollars, so the data driven strategy this project proposes must ensure a profit of at least 1.54 million dollars to address the increased costs. Furthermore, the motivations for the chair lift installation was to attract more visitors, so our proposed solution must help increase the average number of visitors from the current 350,000. 

3. Scope of Solution Space: this helps us narrow down the task even further so we have a more spcific problem to solve. It would be lovely to say we can 'make the resort more profitable' but in what time-frame? What does 'more profitable' actually mean when it doesn't outline by how much we want to increase profits. For this project we want to see the increase in profits of 1.54 million and the increase in the number of visitors by the end of the year. 

4. Constraints within the Solution Space: This is an opportunity to proactively identifying possible problems before they actually occur so we can avoid major issues. For this project, the dataset didn't provide information about the different types of customers they have, nor any idea on what facilities are popular with which customers. Furthermore, snowfall is dependent on weather conditions. Lack of snowfall results in increased costs as the resort might have to provide fake snow in popular routes. Without detailed information about these conditions we will have limitations to what our solution can acheive. Whilst, we can still provide a meaningful insight into a data driven strategy, it's important to note the limitations as well. 

5. Stakeholders: This tells us who can provide insights and also who we will be liasing with. Stakeholders can provide domain knowledge pretaining to the specific needs of the project. Furthermore, knowing who the stakeholders are also allows us to understand how to present out findings. If the stakeholders are the technical team of a company, we need to ensure we can communicate the techincal know-hows effectively to justify our findings. For this project we were given the names and positions of the stakeholders. 

6. Key Data Sources Required? This gives us an idea of what data we have access to, whether they can add more value to the data provided or if they can provide other types of domain knowledge for the project. 

**Synthesized Problem Statement: Implement a data driven business strategy which highlights the current facilities at Big Mountain Resort to increase ticket prices resulting in an increase of profits by at least 1.54 Million USD per season in the coming 12 months.**
